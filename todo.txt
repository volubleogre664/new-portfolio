# Things to do to my portfolio.
=====================================

1. Make it an app with different pages and loading animations when
   when switching pages.

2. Rework the projects, make it a whole project and add my portfolio
   to the projects I have done.

3. Make my cloud function secure and understand how the whole thing works.

4. Add different theme colors, maybe 3 will be fine.
   -> The themes will be switched on the floating button that will open a modal.
   -> Let's make this portfolio a symbol of my frontend skills.

5. Try to add some sense of interactivity to it.

6. Find out how to add loading page in react router dom.

7. Will have to make a config JSON file for my terminal to use and store
   all the available commands and stuff like the history.
   That if a user clicks the arrow up button it should go up the list of items
   in the history stack or queue
